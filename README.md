Trying to make a tool that can, for any arbitrary Minecraft seed, simulate the generation of all 128 strongholds
and determine how many ender eyes each portal generates with.

Currently have something that runs (only took 3 months), but it still gives incorrect output.

Inspiration for this idea came from watching Couriway's 100k no reset speedruns, and I think it would be
really cool to be able to find cool and rare occurrences in the worlds from his 100k challenge that he didnt 
see in the actual run.

Starting with eyes in end portals bc I think it is one of the coolest things to check for.

Oh yeah and in case it wasnt obvious I am designing this for Java Edition version 1.16.1 only.
Maybe I will expand this and make it compatible with other versions in the future, but no promises.
